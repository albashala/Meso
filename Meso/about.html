                A lack of interest in education and learning has been noticed a long <br>
                 time ago, and it has been caused mostly because of the lack of <br>
                  excitement students get when they are told to study. At <a href="home.html"><b>Meso.com</b></a> we <br>
                   seek to fix that.
                   <br>
                   <a href="home.html"><b>Meso.com</b></a> is a Web Platform that intends to help the youth during <br>
                 their learning journey. We try to be different from other platforms, by <br>
                  making the process of learning school subjects fun. And we do that by <br>
                   engaging our customers with fun activities, that make them more <br>
                    interested in learning and more excited about it. At <a href="home.html"><b>Meso.com</b></a>, <br>
                     learning is like a game where you have fun and feel included and <br>
                      validated while at the same time studying which helps you get further in <br>
                       life.
